Working on my Odoo cookbook

Creating interactive kanban cards
spent a bit of time troubleshooting why crash when using dropdown menu on kanban card: finally found the hypen is required!  
<div class="dropdown-menu" role="menu">

Adding a progress bar in kanban views
I did not try to link the sum_field attribute to calc other float/integer fields.

Using Python code server actions
Server actions based on python can allow advanced business rules without the need to create addon modules.
After creating the server actions it is required to upgrade the project module.

Enabling the archive option for records
This is quite simple really.
