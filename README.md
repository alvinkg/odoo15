Working on my Odoo cookbook

Creating interactive kanban cards
spent a bit of time troubleshooting why crash when using dropdown menu on kanban card: finally found the hypen is required!  
<div class="dropdown-menu" role="menu">

Adding a progress bar in kanban views
I did not try to link the sum_field attribute to calc other float/integer fields.
